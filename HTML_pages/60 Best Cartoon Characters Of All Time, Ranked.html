As a gen-Xer, she has been an avid TV, film, and gaming fan since her channel-surfing, Atari-playing '80s childhood. She earned her BA in English and Political Science and most of a graduate degree in English Lit from Northeastern State University in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Kristi has written for many digital and print publications including Film Fracture, VOX Magazine Oklahoma, and Oklahoma Music Magazine. Since 2017, Kristi has been a regular blogger and contributor for TulsaKids Magazine, where you can find her blog Coffee Nebula. When she\u2019s not writing about film, you can catch her playing Fallout 4 or Dungeons and Dragons, attending conventions in cosplay, and fanatically watching the latest Netflix trailers to find out what she\u2019s going to binge next.","url":"https:\/\/www.looper.com\/author\/kristiroeowen","knowsAbout":["Movies","TV","Gaming"],"alumniOf":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Northeastern State University"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Looper","url":"https:\/\/www.looper.com\/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.looper.com\/img\/Looper_RGB.png","width":"1167","height":"583"},"brand":{"@type":"Brand","name":"Looper","type":"Thing","sameAs":["http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LooperMoviesTV","https:\/\/twitter.com\/looper","https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/looper","https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/looperhq","https:\/\/flipboard.com\/@Looper"]}},"description":"Over the course of the past 100 years, there have been some truly incredible animated characters in film and television.

															<p><p dir="ltr">These days, there are so many great animated shows and movies aimed at all ages that plenty of folks still turn to cartoons as a respite from the real world. Animation is a modern art form: It can be a commentary on society and a way of understanding the world, giving viewers the opportunity to see themselves in those colorful characters. But unlike live-action shows, cartoon characters often live in worlds of boundless possibility, creating a fertile space for exploring complex ideas, dabbling in the absurd, and parodying subjects that might be too sensitive to cover elsewhere.</p>

</script></div>
<p>No matter how old viewers are or what generation they were born in, most have fond memories of cartoons that made an impression on them during their formative years. From early cartoons like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32pzHWUTcPc" target="_blank">Gertie the Dinosaur</a> to iconic Disney villains like Ursula, everyone has their favorite. After considering everything from cult followings to cultural impact, we're ranking the 60 best cartoon characters of all time.</p>

More of a cartoon everyman and goody-goody, Mickey has nonetheless earned his place as one of the most iconic cartoons of all time by becoming a key component of the Disney image, encompassing family fun and pure, unadulterated consumerism.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">First dreamed up in 1928 by Walt Disney, Mickey is a case study in branding, with his signature red shorts and yellow shoes as recognizable as the Disney font. Although he's undergone a few facelifts over the years, this enduring mouse has stood the test of time through countless cartoons, books, and films, managing to connect with generation after generation.</p>

															<p><p>Jazz Age beauty Betty Boop has been around for almost a century and still looks great for her age. First appearing as a cabaret singer in the 1930 cartoon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6aY_BXWUc" target="_blank">"Dizzy Dishes,"</a> her canine features evolved until she was reimagined as a big-eyed flapper and modern young woman. With her feminine features and body-contouring attire, Betty was a character who embraced her sexuality on her own terms, which is part of why she's still beloved today. <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25509/happy-belated-birthday-betty-boop" target="_blank">Mental Floss</a> called Betty a "feminist icon," noting that the subject matter of Betty Boop cartoons often focused on her fight against powerful men attempting to harass her.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">If there's one cartoon character who always seems to have his act together in all the wrong ways, it's Bart Simpson. With a catchphrase for every occasion from "Eat my shorts" to "¡Ay, caramba!" and advanced skills in orneriness, pranking, and tomfoolery, Bart is the cartoon embodiment of a troublemaking tween. Something of a Gen-X antihero, Bart is always sticking it to the man, fully at peace with his existence as the ultimate cool kid slacker.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>From the chalkboard gag at the beginning of every episode of "The Simpsons" to his frequent nude scenes, Bart is always up to something. In the early '90s, his popularity reached a fever pitch with the cultural phenomenon known as "Bartmania." And he's still clocking in today as "The Simpsons" holds its ground as the <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/29/the-simpsons-record-gunsmoke-review/" target="_blank">longest-running scripted show</a> on television.</p>

With his childlike ways and love of whimsical endeavors like jellyfishing, SpongeBob is a huge nuisance to his stick-in-the-mud neighbor Squidward Tentacles. A working-class hero, SpongeBob finds joy in his job flipping Krabby Patties at the Krusty Crab, even when his money-grubbing boss is the living worst. He's also a pretty good influence on everyone around him, and his devotion to his dim but lovable pal Patrick is nothing if not a bromance for the ages. With his own TV series and a handful of films, it's hard not to love this invertebrate.</p>

Steven (voiced by Zach Callison) is an adolescent boy with some very unique abilities, thanks to his mom Rose Quartz, who just happened to be from an alien species known as the <a href="https://www.looper.com/195686/the-most-powerful-gems-in-steven-universe/" target="_blank">Gems</a>. The series follows Steven's coming-of-age story as he struggles with his identity as a half-Gem and gradually steps into his mother's footsteps as a protector of the human race.</p>

<p>Steven's exploration of his own feelings and relationships serves as a positive role model for younger viewers, but his story is complex enough for older fans to enjoy as well. His characterization has been praised for its defiance of compulsory gender performance, with Susana Polo of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2016/5/11/11604098/steven-universe-explained" target="_blank">Polygon</a> calling the show a "toxic masculinity antidote" that is "subversive in a positive way."</p>

															<p><p>Like his son Bart, Homer is one of the more flawed members of the Simpson family. In many ways, Homer Simpson embodies some of the worst stereotypes of Americans. He's infamously lazy, inconsiderate, self-absorbed, demanding, and embarrassing. Over the years, he's done countless awful things, from gaining 61 pounds and dressing in a muumuu to collect a disability check ("King-Sized Homer") to framing his own wife for drunk driving ("Co-Dependents' Day"). While Homer's failings are numerous, the support of his wife and children somehow leads to his redemption again and again, and there's something awfully comforting about the idea of America's worst dad getting by with the help of his family.</p>

One of the great things about Scooby's adventures is that they teach kids to be skeptical when faced with things that don't make sense.

															<p><p>The patriarch of his modern stone-age family, Fred Flintstone is a double blast from the past. On the surface, he's a prehistoric family man. But to modern viewers, Fred is a 20th-century relic offering a glimpse into another side of the "Mad Men" era. While Fred can be hotheaded and a bit backward at times, he's a good friend to Barney Rubble, and he worships the ground his wife Wilma walks on. And in an era when many men were absent from their families as they worked to achieve the suburban dream, Fred understood the concept of work-life balance. He always seemed to have his priorities straight, working hard to spend time with his family and enjoy his favorite pastimes: Bowling and hanging out at the Lodge.</p>

Although he's technically an ordinary beagle, Snoopy is an anthropomorphic canine of exceptional talents. With the help of his trusty typewriter, Snoopy enjoys working on the Great American Novel. He also uses his vivid imagination to engage in a little LARPing every now and then, often pretending he's a World War I pilot going up against his nemesis, the Red Baron. Like his owner Charlie Brown, Snoopy's popularity has lasted for generations, with his recognizable balloon a staple of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade for decades.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Charlie Brown is popular in part because he's utterly relatable. He struggles with social anxiety and more than his fair share of bad luck, but he works hard to overcome his insecurities. Since his first appearance in a <a href="https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/11/03" target="_blank">1950 "Peanuts" comic</a>, Charlie has become one of the most beloved cartoon characters of all time. His cultural impact is significant, with the Charlie Brown walk so recognizable it even became a running gag in "Arrested Development."</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>He has always been a fine pal to his classmates, even the ones who give him a hard time, like Lucy. And Charlie Brown helped break boundaries in 1968 when he <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/features/2020/01/30/quite-frankly-peanuts-character-franklin-had-a-major-cultural-impact/" target="_blank">became friends with Franklin</a>, a Black student whose dad was serving in Vietnam. Charlie Brown also understands the value of man's best friend, becoming inconsolably heartbroken when Snoopy leaves home in "Snoopy Come Home."</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">At 103 years old, Felix the Cat is one of the world's oldest cartoon characters, dating back to the silent film era. The original silent shorts are a reminder that cartoons were once primarily made for an older audience, often featuring adult situations and settings. A prime example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxailD4Ofq4" target="_blank">"Woos Whoopee,"</a> which was set in a nightclub and featured Felix dancing on a table with a foamy mug of beer before getting hammered on wine, despite the cartoon's 1930 release falling squarely in the Prohibition era.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Felix is an early example of an impactful animation style known as "rubber hose animation," with cartoons full of wonderfully surreal elements from dancing buildings to bizarre creatures. The style is still beloved today, with its lasting influence showing up most recently in the popular video games "Cuphead" and "Bendy and the Ink Machine."</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">He may not have much to say, but Hanna-Barbera's classic mouse is as clever and adorable as they come. While always under attack from his arch-nemesis Tom the Cat, Jerry is no victim. On the contrary, Jerry seems to delight in outfoxing his feline counterpart and turning the cat-and-mouse archetype on its head. Easily one of the most recognizable cartoon character duos of all time, <a href="https://www.looper.com/196800/the-untold-truth-of-tom-and-jerry/" target="_blank">"Tom and Jerry"</a> hearken back to a time when cartoon violence was celebrated, a trope parodied in "The Simpsons" show-within-the-show, "Itchy and Scratchy." But at the end of the day, these furry frenemies seem to genuinely care about each other.</p>

<p>After all the furry fisticuffs, Jerry's always there for Tom, comforting him over a broken heart and stopping him from making bad decisions. The relationship bears a resemblance to a healthy sibling rivalry, as they constantly tangle with each other in a way that makes them both stronger.</p>

															<p><p>If there's anyone who understands how cats deserve to be lavished with affection, it's "Garfield" creator Jim Davis. A fat, lasagna-loving orange tabby, according to <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/06/why-we-don-t-hate-garfield.html" target="_blank">Slate</a>, Garfield was conceptualized with mass-marketing and merchandising in mind, and it worked. In the 1980s, as mass consumption and commercialism were targeting children like never before, it was the rare kid who didn't have a Garfield plush, an "I hate Mondays" poster, or a coveted <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47732553" target="_blank">Garfield phone</a>. But part of Garfield's lasting appeal is that underneath all that cheesy consumerism, there's something wildly relatable about Garfield's sarcasm and slackerish ways. And with the new Chris Pratt "Garfield" film, it looks like he'll be around for a while.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Smarter than the average bear and always getting in the ranger's hair, Yogi Bear has been featured in several TV series and comics over the years. In his home of Jellystone Park, Yogi Bear has a love for "pic-a-nic" baskets and a girlfriend he just can't seem to commit to. After getting his start on "The Huckleberry Hound Show," Yogi became a big enough star to get his own series.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Yogi's many attempts to outsmart the park ranger are often the focus of the show, and for a bear like Yogi, being stuck in the wilderness is torture. After all, with his green skinny tie and pork pie hat, Yogi would fit right in at a 1960s office party. But Yogi's efforts to leave are much more than a city bear trying to escape his hometown for better things. As the main attraction of Jellystone Park, Yogi resents the way the park's bears are exploited. But despite his frustration, Yogi always manages to find comfort in the little things, like his friendship with Boo-Boo Bear and sneaking snacks from park guests. And thanks to his new <a href="https://www.looper.com/445997/new-jellystone-trailer-brings-together-the-hanna-barbera-shared-universe/" target="_blank">"Jellystone!" series</a> on HBO Max, it looks like Yogi might finally make it out of the park after all.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Voiced by beloved voice actor John DiMaggio, Bender of "Futurama" is the quintessential cartoon robot. Like Marvin the Paranoid Android from "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," Bender is <a href="https://www.looper.com/166107/the-absolute-worst-things-bender-has-ever-done-on-futurama/" target="_blank">deeply flawed</a>, but he's also a reminder of the healing power of friendship. After the Tijuana-built robot learns that the girders he was created to bend are used in suicide booths, he becomes profoundly depressed and decides to kill himself. When the anachronistic Fry mistakes the same suicide booth for a phone booth, Bender offers to go sharesies on the quarter admission price, and the two become fast friends, eventually becoming soulmates.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">A somewhat sociopathic antihero, Bender runs on booze, frequently waxes on about killing all humans, and pathologically lies, cheats, and steals. But despite his many flaws, Bender truly cares for Fry and often shows remorse when his actions harm the few people he actually likes. As for everyone else? As Bender would be happy to tell them, they can all bite his shiny metal ass.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate baby genius, "Family Guy" prodigy Stewie Griffin (voiced by creator Seth McFarlane) is a child constantly underestimated by everyone around him. While the rugby ball-headed Stewie plots to kill his mother Lois or take over the world, his efforts are often met with a dismissive "Oh, you are just so cute!" or "Mommy loves you!" As McFarlane told <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1042476/seth-macfarlanes-2-billion-family-guy-empire" target="_blank">Fast Company's Josh Dean</a>, Stewie's inexplicably pretentious British accent is based on Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins from "My Fair Lady," a voice that Stewie eventually reveals to be an affectation in a therapy session ("Send in Stewie, Please").</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">While his friendship with Brian the Dog is fairly toxic and often features verbal and physical abuse and neglect, their adventures together are nonetheless a highlight of the show. Although Stewie often struggles to understand what the deuce is going on in the Griffin home, he's still usually the smartest guy in the room.</p>

															<p><p>The subject of the first-ever "The Jetsons" episode, Rosie the Robot (originally spelled "Rosey") is the Jetson family's robotic maid. First hired by the Jetsons from U-Rent A Maid, Rosie is much more than a sentient vacuum cleaner (despite being a piece of obsolete technology). Rosie's service to the retrofuturist Atomic Age family is a bit troubling at first, with Jane Jetson picking her up because she just doesn't like doing housework. But Rosie seems to be incredibly grateful to be living with a family and doing what she loves, initially asking George how much the family would charge her to work for them. She even becomes close to the kids, affectionately calling Elroy "Roy Boy" in her robotic Brooklyn accent. With her subtle snark, frilly maid attire, cylindrical features, and whirring gears, Rosie is still rolling into hearts today.</p>

															<p><p>Xennials and Millenials who grew up with Arthur Timothy Read may cringe to hear it, but the bespectacled aardvark is well into his 40s these days. As <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/182244-why-arthur-was-the-best-cartoon-character-of-the-90s" target="_blank">Bustle's</a> Sabienna Bowman observed, Arthur is "a quintessential '90s kid" with his love of pop culture and creative imagination. One of the things that makes Arthur such a great character is that he normalizes personal growth, often having to course-correct after he's realized he's made a bad decision. A fairly normal eight-year-old kid with a best friend and a slightly awkward persona, one of Arthur's best qualities is his love of books. While <a href="https://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/blogs/news/arthur-celebrates-25th-anniversary-on-pbs-kids-with-special-marathon-and-big-reveal/" target="_blank">PBS KIDS</a> reported that the show's 25-year run would end in 2022, the network simultaneously announced plans for new streaming content and a podcast to continue teaching a new generation all about the magic of friendship, books, and pop culture.</p>

															<p><p>Wubba lubba dub-dub! The eponymous Rick of "Rick and Morty" is one of the most abrasive and dysfunctional characters on the list, but his cultural impact has nonetheless earned him a place. If there was any question that Rick is an alter-ego version of Doctor Emmett Brown from "Back to the Future," co-creator Justin Roiland's <a href="https://vimeo.com/97680161" target="_blank">original parody</a> "Doc and Mharti" swiftly puts it to rest. While Rick is hardly likable, he is nonetheless interesting and hilarious. Rick is many things: a chaotic neutral mad scientist with sociopathic tendencies, filthy-mouthed supergenius, pansexual lover, drunk septuagenarian, and interdimensional party boy. But most of all, he's a friend to his grandson, Morty ... at least when he's not imperiling the boy across the fabric of spacetime.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">The bane of South Park Elementary, Eric Cartman is probably the least likable kid in the town of South Park, Colorado, constantly abusing everyone around him. Nonetheless, he is one of the most memorable characters in the series, with Cartman catchphrases like "Respect ma authoritah!" and "Screw you guys, I'm going home," becoming ubiquitous in the late 1990s.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Despite his constant rudeness, selfishness, and all-around abusive behavior, Cartman is essential to his group of four best friends, with the two-part story in "South Park: Post Covid" and "South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid" concluding that Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and Stan remaining friends leads to the best timeline. And despite Cartman's many failings, it's hard not to admire his no-filter approach to life, even if it finds him saying some decidedly horrible things.</p>

Kicking off in 1994 on Cartoon Network and then later moving to Adult Swim, "Space Ghost Coast to Coast" placed Space Ghost behind a talk show desk interviewing celebrity guests. His persona on the show is strange, awkward, and fairly inept, leading to some bizarre and hilarious interviews.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.4/3.4pages/3.4kenyon_pm.html" target="_blank">Animation World Magazine's</a> Heather Kenyon, guests would answer somewhere between 20 to 25 questions given through an earpiece and asked to imagine they were coming from a superhero. After the interview, writers would piece together Space Ghost's dialogue, sometimes changing the questions. Space Ghost managed to interview the likes of Jim Carrey, David Byrne, Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, and William Shatner, to name just a few.</p>

A throwback to the golden age of animation, Roger is everything a Toon should be with his wacky mannerisms, over-the-top personality, and classic cartoon appearance. Roger lives in Toontown, the animated version of Hollywood, where he's something of a star. But after Roger is confronted with images of his sultry wife Jessica playing patty cake with Toontown owner Marvin Acme, he becomes implicated in the man's murder. The carrot cake-loving Toon was an instant hit when the film came out, with his popularity earning him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pua9UszdO24" target="_blank">his very own dance move</a>.</p>

With his lightning bolt-shaped tail and adorable anime style, Pikachu is one of the cutest cartoon characters on the list. Despite Pikachu's small stature, he constantly shows strength and bravery, eagerly stepping into any battle his Pokémon trainer Ash puts him into.</p>

Pikachu's popularity blew up so much in the '90s that Time named him second on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090303173742/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1220/1999bw.people.html" target="_blank">"Best People of 1999"</a> list, coming in just under Ricky Martin.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">With his unusually large size and thick Southern drawl, Foghorn Leghorn has some of the best shade in the biz. Although his origin has become largely forgotten today, Foghorn is a parody of a comedy radio show character meant to lampoon Southern-fried politicians, according to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/09/claghorn-leghorn-thompson/225534/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>. Appearing on "The Fred Allen Show" in the mid-1940s, Senator Beauregard Claghorn was a loudmouthed southern who loathed the North above all.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>Like Claghorn, Foghorn relishes his role as an expert, frequently addressing others as "boy" or "son" and interjecting his lessons with "I say, I say, I say." Watching a few episodes featuring the boisterous rooster is a bit like having a crash course in insult comedy, with zingers like "That boy's like a tattoo. He gets under your skin," "You look like two miles of bad road," and "Nice girl, but 'bout as sharp as a sack 'o wet mice."</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">The cartoon world is full of overconfident chickens, chief among them Chicken Boo of "Animaniacs" fame (voiced by Frank Welker). Like Foghorn Leghorn, Chicken Boo is an unusually large chicken. But not content to hang out on the farm and mentor barnyard animals, Chicken Boo prefers to wear a disguise to look human. Despite his obvious featheriness, inability to speak outside of squawking sounds, tendency to peck at the ground looking for feed, and the fact that he's literally just a chicken in clothing or in one case, only a mustache, Chicken Boo constantly fools people everywhere he goes.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>While others fawn over him, there's always one solitary detractor wondering what is wrong with everyone else that they don't recognize Chicken Boo as an actual chicken. At some point during his adventures, Chicken Boo's disguise always comes off, and everyone suddenly realizes he is indeed a chicken, much to their horror. The absurd humor is a prime example of what makes "Animaniacs" comedy gold, and somewhere under all those feathers, a commentary on groupthink is waiting to be pecked at.</p>

The adorable little monkey lives up to his name, constantly getting into messes and keeping his best buddy Ted on his toes. The star of many books, films, and even his own television series, George is one of the most charming and wholesome children's characters of all time. He exudes childlike wonder at everything he encounters, which can get him into a pickle or two every now and then. In many ways, Curious George resembles a toddler or preschooler with his insatiable curiosity and his pure love of life. And like a toddler, George needs the help and protection of his surrogate dad, reminding little ones that it's okay to explore the world as long as they stay close to their families.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the original Japanese series, Michiru (Sailor Neptune) and Haruka (Sailor Uranus) were a lesbian couple.

<p dir="ltr">Still, many American kids gleaned enough from the subtext to infer the original relationship. For countless queer youth, "Sailor Moon" offered rare representation and visibility. In their 2014 re-release of the series, VIZ Media would redub the series to remove the original censorship, restoring the couple to the status they deserve.</p>

															<p><p>With all of the countless memorable "Star Trek" characters in the world, it's hard to pick a favorite. But of all the Federation's engineers, captains, and various ensigns, Ensign Bradward Boimler (Jack Quaid) of the USS Cerritos ("Star Trek: Lower Decks") is arguably the most lovable. Boimler is the rule-obsessed coworker everyone has known at one point or another, with his desperation to get noticed by commanding officers landing him in some tricky predicaments. But one of the best things about Boimler is his relationship with his lower-deck friends, especially his counterpart, Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome). Together, their opposite personalities are a perfect example of Starfleet cooperation.</p>

<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Despite her best efforts to improve her situation, Retsuko's life never really changes, making her heartbreakingly relatable. At the end of the day, "Aggretsuko" is about looking for ways to make the daily grind more bearable and learning that sometimes happiness depends on making peace with a situation that's inescapable. While the message is bleak, there's also something refreshing about the show's honesty.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">During the 1980s, Hasbro's My Little Pony toy line was wildly popular. In response to the toys' success, Hasbro produced a handful of animations. When animator Lauren Faust was tasked with bringing back the world of My Little Pony for a new generation in "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic," she set out to change the very nature of what it meant to be a show written for girls. As she wrote in <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal/" target="_blank">Ms. Magazine</a>, Faust's previous efforts to pitch original shows aimed at girls to various networks had been met with the feedback that cartoons were for boys. Faust saw that the problem was not that girls didn't like cartoons, but that there was a poor understanding of what would appeal to girls in cartoons.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Faust populated Equestria with all types of female characters, and one of the best is Rainbow Dash. An antidote to the requisite girly girl stereotype, Rainbow Dash is athletic and self-confident. With her blue coat, rainbow mane and tail, dark sunglasses, and tomboy personality, Rainbow Dash exudes casual coolness and avoids traditional gender stereotypes, making her accessible to kids of all genders.</p>

One of the <a href="https://www.looper.com/162840/inspector-gadget-details-that-only-adults-notice/" target="_blank">darker theories</a> is that Inspector Gadget is actually a robot copy of the original, who was so badly disfigured and damaged that he went on to become Dr. Claw and has vowed to take revenge on his robotic duplicate.

Frustrated, frowny, and fundamentally flawed, Donald is the anti-Mickey, here to save the world from the annoying optimism of the Disney mouse. But far from being a Negative Nancy, Donald often has a positive outlook. It's just that his hotheaded temper tends to take over when he gets all caught up in his feelings. A bit of prankster, Donald is actually really loving and tries hard to keep his emotions under control (even if he typically isn't successful). And it's hard not to love the characteristic Donald Duck voice, originally performed by Clarence Nash, which is a classic example of the alaryngeal vocal style known as buccal speech, per <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/553913/disney-urban-legends/" target="_blank">/Film</a>.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Disney's dazzling "Star vs. the Forces of Evil" features another adorable girl with super abilities, Star. Hailing from the parallel but magical dimension of Mewni, Star is sent to Earth when it's clear she's out of control, disobedient, and can't handle her own powers. Star's appearance is whimsical with her devil horn headband, pink heart-stamped cheeks, and striped tights, but she is part of a strong matriarchal lineage and destined to take power. Star defies the princess stereotype at almost every turn with her headstrong ways and refusal to accept the role others choose for her. Many critics have praised the series for depicting a character who is both feminine and powerful at the same time, with <a href="https://decider.com/2017/11/15/cult-corner-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/" target="_blank">Decider</a> praising Star for being "unapologetically herself."</p>

															<p><p>Of all the "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" characters, Porky has changed more than any other. Despite his characteristic stuttering, Porky always manages to get his point across. He's often the smartest guy in the room or at the very least, the best at being an adult, understanding the value of a good night's sleep and a hard day's work. While he might have his hands full with various Toons getting underfoot at times, Porky can be obscenely competent at almost everything he does. He's a skilled equestrian, railroad conductor, and restaurant owner, to name just a few of his talents. With his adorable face and serious work ethic, Porky would be a great support system for Retsuko.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Created by Muriel Fahrion and Barbi Sargent for American Greetings, Strawberry Shortcake is a decades-old character who still gets plenty of love today. But with a handful of television specials and almost limitless merchandising potential, Strawberry Shortcake products were everywhere during the '80s.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">There was something about Strawberry Shortcake that really resonated with young girls at the time, and she was a work of marketing mastery, gracing lunch boxes, bedroom sets, and even drinking glasses. With her ragdoll hair, oversized strawberry bonnet, red dress, white apron, and pink custard kitty, Strawberry Shortcake is downright adorable, a reminder that sometimes it's okay to love something just because it's cute.</p>

															<p><p>The most interesting boy in all of Arlen, Texas, Bobby Hill is arguably the true star of Mike Judge's "King of the Hill." In a world where pre-pubescent kids are often depicted one-dimensionally or at the very least, woefully underestimated, Bobby is like a round little onion with layer upon layer of charm, smarts, and personality. Daniel Kurland of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/king-of-the-hill-most-likable-characters/" target="_blank">CBR</a> marveled that the pre-growth-spurt adolescent is "arguably the most well-adjusted and positive character in the series," often meeting criticism and challenges with faith in himself and a commitment to try harder. He's precocious and fiercely individualistic, unafraid to pursue his various interests, which include comedy, rodeo clowning, cooking, and ventriloquism, just to name a few.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, people who seem uptight are really just awkward or misunderstood, and Squidward Tentacles of "SpongeBob SquarePants" is a perfect example. He's depicted as constantly put-upon, but a closer look reveals that he may actually be the best character in the series. Although he's always giving SpongeBob and Patrick a hard time, to be fair, they are genuinely terrible neighbors, often behaving with little regard for those around them.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Squidward is a reminder that introverts can get overlooked or disregarded by their extrovert counterparts. Often left out of SpongeBob and Patrick's antics, Squidward also endures the pain of watching the cool kids from the sidelines. But even after all the late-night wakeup calls and unexpected home demolitions his neighbors cause, Squidward still cares about the pair and seems to consider them friends, even if it's not the deep and abiding bromance they're looking for.</p>

With her pink hair, pop star style, and holographic earrings, she showed an entire generation of kids that it's possible to be more than one thing at a time. Gifted a holographic computer named Synergy by her late dad, Jerrica Benton leads a double life as a businesswoman by day and rock star Jem by night. The series retains a cult following to this day, with fans flocking to an annual convention called <a href="https://jemcon.xyz/" target="_blank">Jemcon</a>. Latonya Pennington of <a href="https://www.intomore.com/film/jem-holograms-deserves-new-animated-adaptation/" target="_blank">Into</a> argued that the series is ripe for rebooting thanks to its queer subtext, racial diversity, and depiction of women balancing professional careers and personal lives while still making time to help others. With so many great reboots coming out all the time, let's hope someone listens.</p>

Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are triplets who were left in a basket on struggling musician Dave Seville's porch by their mother ("The Chipmunks Story"). It's never really made clear why the chipmunks talk, but Dave quickly bonds with the trio, adopting them as his own sons and going on to record plenty of bestselling music with their help.</p>

<p>While each chipmunk is adorable in his own way, Simon is the best of the three. He can be a bit rude at times and is often far too bossy to his brothers, but Simon can also be a caring and sensitive chipmunk. With his super-high IQ, Simon is a skilled inventor and tech geek. A born leader, he's far more responsible than his brothers, but he can still totally get down when it's time to rock.</p>

															<p><p>If Scooby-Doo taught us anything, it's that it's okay to be a cowardly dog ... as long as you're still willing to face your fears. But unlike Scooby-Doo, the paranormal creeps Courage encounters are real. "Courage the Cowardly Dog" is an animated show that defies conventions, integrating elements of the absurd and surreal into a clever and bizarre comedy-horror series. As Sean Malin observed in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/courage-the-cowardly-dog-john-dilworth.html?regwall-newsletter-signup=true" target="_blank">Vulture</a>, the series spins horrifying imagery out of elements taken from Salvador Dali and slapstick, blending "body horror and Chaplinesque comedy." And in the face of it all, the paranoid Courage always manages to overcome his terror, never leaving his people hanging.</p>

And of course, as anyone who has seen "Where the Wild Things Are" can attest, little kids just look cute with animal ears on their heads.</p>

It premiered on ABC in the United States and would become one of the earliest animes to become popular stateside. While the dubbing is a bit of a mess, with its hilariously fast dialogue, the series is a pretty straightforward adventure.</p>

Although he's hardly the best boyfriend to Trixie, Speed has plenty of other heroic attributes and skills. He is a decent fighter, for example, easily besting his opponents in hand-to-hand combat. But what makes Speed such a great character is his willingness to risk his own safety for others, modeling what it means to be a hero.</p>

															<p><p dir="ltr">For generations of cartoon lovers, the phrase "Pink Panther" instantly calls to mind the iconic Henry Mancini theme music. With its simple animation style and trippy stories, the series is a visual odyssey. One of the simpler cartoon characters on the list, Pink Panther (voiced by Rich Little) is a pink cat with yellow eyes, a British accent, and occasionally, a tiny robe. The series would be rebooted in the 1990s starring Matt Frewer ("Max Headroom") and featuring a more intense version of the Mancini theme.</p>
<div class="google-ad-placeholder between-p" data-ad-height="any" data-ad-width="any" data-ad-pos="between-p"></div>
<p>The Pink Panther is often curious, but exudes a laid-back attitude, making him the ultimate cool cat. This combination of traits lands him in some pretty dodgy scenarios, from haunted houses to a Wonderland-esque psychedelic bookstore. One of the things that makes the <a href="https://www.looper.com/289779/the-untold-truth-of-the-pink-panther/" target="_blank">Pink Panther</a> great is his reliance on pantomime, which gives him plenty of opportunities for hilarious cartoon physics and surrealism.</p>
